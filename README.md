# Browser Adventure Game
A text decision based game inspired by the early 90's MS-DOS games. 


Building framework for browser game in Javascript, and client game with Tkinter and Python.

Plan:

    Basic 6x6 block screen to show a map. Text box beneath that to input commands.

    Map randomly generated 
        (Math.floor(x) or something similar). 

    Random item finding.
        Item ratings 1 - 3.
    
    Player Detail:
        health: 
        sword: 
        armour:
        movement commands: forward, turn right, turn left

    Enemy Detail:
        health:
        weapon value:
        armor value:
        enemy placement random: grid square cords. 

    Endless adventure:
        endless mode: random non-ending dungeon generation.
        story mode: find the end of the dungeon, random number between 5-50. floors will be selected randomly. Once 50 is reached the mission will be over.


Mission Statement:
    Will ensure dull enjoyment for people at work or school without worrying about it looking like a game. People of the 90's had it right, simple on art, technical skill/engine working to bring the fun. This will hopefully bring a level of immersion and endless fun, or focused based game.

    This game should be simple, and forward with no extra focus on graphics but rather showing the player where they are.
